                    <ul>
                      <li>	Nowadays <strong>80% of data stores in unstructured manner</strong>, transformation of this unstructured data into the structured interpretable format is a major challenge for Big Data mining.
                      <li>	<strong>High volume data generation</strong> is another important aspect, which is required to be concerned for tackling Big Data. Processes and tools should be organised in adequate manner with which high volume of data set can be processed in reasonable amount of time.
                      <li>	Immediate analysis result is major issues in Big Data due to huge volume of data. Sometime real time (quick) result of analysis is required for reasonable decision making.
                      <li>	<strong>Issues related to security</strong> have to be handled in proper manner as data in <strong>Big Data comes from various type of sources</strong>. This can be done with implementation of techniques such as <strong>verification, encryption and key management, logging and watermarking techniques</strong> (Desarkar and Das 2017).<a href = "references.html#reference_two">[2]</a>
